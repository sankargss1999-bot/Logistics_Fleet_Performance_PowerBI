# ðŸšš Logistics & Transportation â€“ Fleet Performance & Delivery Efficiency

### ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes a logistics companyâ€™s fleet performance based on delivery efficiency, fuel usage, and operational cost metrics.  
It aims to identify improvement areas and optimize transportation routes and vehicle utilization.

---

### ðŸ§© Dataset Details
- **Trip_Data.csv**
  - Trip ID, Vehicle ID, Driver ID, Origin, Destination, Distance (km), Fuel Consumed, Delivery Status, Delivery Date.
- **Vehicle_Master.csv**
  - Vehicle ID, Vehicle Type, Capacity, Maintenance Cost.

---

### ðŸ§¹ 1. Data Cleaning & Modeling (5 Marks)
- Replaced missing `Fuel Consumed` values with **average per Vehicle Type** using Power Query.
- Created relationship between `Trips` and `Vehicle Master` tables using `Vehicle ID (1:* )`.

---

### ðŸ“Š 2. DAX Measures (5 Marks)
| Measure | Formula | Purpose |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Fuel Efficiency** | `Distance / Fuel Consumed` | Analyze vehicle performance |
| **On-Time Delivery %** | `On-Time Trips / Total Trips` | Measure punctuality |
| **Cost per km** | `(Fuel Cost + Maintenance Cost) / Distance` | Evaluate operational cost |

---

### ðŸ“ˆ 3. Visualizations (5 Marks)
| Visual | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Bar Chart** | On-Time Delivery % by Route |
| **Line Chart** | Fuel Efficiency trend by Month |
| **KPI Cards** | Avg. Delivery Time, Cost per km |
| **Map Visual** | Delivery performance by route (Origin â†’ Destination) |

---

### ðŸ§  Insights & Findings
- Improved visibility on delivery delays and fuel efficiency.
- Identified underperforming routes and high-cost vehicles.
- Enabled data-driven decisions to reduce operational costs.
